In recent weeks we’ve had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/11/ai-generated-news-presenter-debuts-in-kuwait-media\">AI newsreaders</a> on Kuwaiti TV, an AI-generated photograph <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/17/photographer-admits-prize-winning-image-was-ai-generated\">winning a major prize</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/20/schumacher-family-planning-legal-action-over-ai-interview-with-f1-great\">AI-generated interview with Michael Schumacher</a> that got an editor sacked and, of course, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2\">numerous warnings</a> that this all might spell the end of humanity itself.</p><p>It’s natural to feel apprehensive about these society-shaking developments.

Amid the sprawling megastructures of the city-planet Coruscant, a daring heist ensues. Having escaped the clutches of Darth Vader’s Imperial inquisition in the last game (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review\">Jedi: Fallen Order</a>), fugitive Jedi Cal Kestis is now an agent for the Rebel Alliance, and his latest target is hidden inside a corrupt senator’s luxury space-yacht.

Respawn Entertainment’s first foray into Disney’s sci-fi universe had moments of vision, particularly in its beginning and ending, but sandwiched in the middle was an uneven mixture of Uncharted-style platforming and combat inspired by Dark Souls, set in environments that only occasionally lived up to the promise of its introduction. Jedi: Survivor is an enthralling follow-up and a huge improvement. Not only is it a masterclass in cinematic action, but its eclectic mixture of mechanics is also much more elegantly implemented. The result is the best Star Wars game in 20 years, as compelling in the hands as it is magnificent on the screen.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/apr/26/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-best-star-wars-game-in-20-years-five-stars\">Continue reading...</a>","category":["Games","Star Wars","Culture","Adventure games","Action games"],"pubDate":"Wed, 26 Apr 2023 15:30:39 GMT","guid":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/apr/26/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-best-star-wars-game-in-20-years-five-stars","media:content":[{"media:credit":"Photograph: Respawn/EA"},{"media:credit":"Photograph: Respawn/EA"}],"dc:creator":"Rick Lane","dc:date":"2023-04-26T15:30:39Z","keywords":{"Survivor":5,"review":4,"years":4,"strong":4,"PlayStation":2,"version":1,"tested":1,"Series":2,"Respawn":8,"Entertainment":8,"sequel":1,"improvement":4,"Fallen":5,"Order":5,"virtual":1,"blockbuster":4,"without":1,"compromise":1,"opening":1,"sequence":1,"spellbinding":1,"sprawling":1,"megastructures":1,"planet":1,"Coruscant":5,"daring":1,"heist":1,"ensues":1,"Having":2,"escaped":1,"clutches":1,"Darth":2,"Vader":2,"Imperial":2,"inquisition":1,"https":4,"theguardian":4,"games":4,"fallen":1,"order":1,"fugitive":1,"Kestis":2,"agent":1,"Rebel":2,"Alliance":2,"latest":1,"target":1,"hidden":1,"inside":1,"corrupt":1,"senator":1,"luxury":1,"space":1,"yacht":4,"follows":1,"minute":1,"thrill":1,"pursues":1,"through":4,"tangled":1,"underbelly":1,"slicing":1,"stormtroopers":1,"pirouetting":1,"across":1,"impossible":1,"architecture":1,"everything":1,"adventure":1,"video":1,"visually":1,"spectacular":1,"mechanically":1,"sophisticated":1,"riotously":1,"entertaining":1,"first":1,"foray":1,"Disney":2,"universe":1,"moments":1,"vision":1,"particularly":1,"beginning":1,"ending":1,"sandwiched":1,"middle":1,"uneven":1,"mixture":4,"Uncharted":2,"style":1,"platforming":1,"combat":1,"inspired":1,"Souls":2,"environments":1,"occasionally":1,"lived":1,"promise":1,"introduction":1,"enthralling":1,"follow":1,"masterclass":1,"cinematic":1,"action":1,"eclectic":1,"mechanics":1,"elegantly":1,"implemented":1,"result":1,"compelling":1,"hands":1,"magnificent":1,"screen":1,"survivor":1,"stars":1,"Continue":2,"reading":1},"summary":"PlayStation 5 (version tested), Xbox Series X/S, PC; Respawn Entertainment/EARespawn Entertainment’s sequel is a huge improvement over Jedi: Fallen Order...","source":"GUARDIAN","feed":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/technology/rss"},{"title":"Activision Blizzard calls UK ‘closed for business’ after Microsoft takeover veto","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/26/microsoft-bid-for-activision-blizzard-blocked-by-uk-competition-regulator","description":"<p>Competition and Markets Authority blocks what would have been biggest acquisition in gaming history</p><p>The Call of Duty developer Activision Blizzard has accused the UK of being “closed for business” after the competition regulator blocked its attempted takeover by Microsoft, which would have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/03/why-a-67bn-takeover-could-make-microsoft-a-gaming-behemoth\">the largest acquisition in gaming history</a>.</p><p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) prevented the $68.7bn (£55bn) cash purchase because of concerns it would squash the cloud gaming market, sparking furious pushback from both sides of the deal.

refund the £2,000 credit on her account","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/27/mum-died-but-ovo-wont-refund-the-2000-credit-on-her-account","description":"<p>The problem is delaying probate and causing great distress</p><p><strong>My mum died in February and her energy supplier Ovo is refusing to return the £2,000 credit on her account. Ovo has admitted errors on her account, which date back to 2019, when a four-digit meter reading was substituted for the five-digit actual reading and used as a basis for subsequent bills. We provided meter readings and photographs, and an agent read the meter in 2021. We were assured that the account would be rectified, but that never happened and the issue is delaying probate. I’ve been told it may take up to 12 weeks to resolve. That £2,000 could have been used for mum’s funeral to give her a better send-off. The issue is causing great distress. <br></strong><em><strong>ZW, London</strong></em></p><p>This makes painful reading. You have had to chase while coping with an inquest into your mother’s death, and ploughing through four years of energy bills. Notes scribbled on the bills by your mother suggest that she spent the last 14 months of her life, if not more, struggling to get her account recalibrated using correct meter readings. Her memos show that during repeated calls she was sometimes kept on hold for more than half an hour, and was passed fruitlessly between departments. At one point she records her distress at receiving a letter in intimidating red ink from Ovo demanding readings that she had already submitted.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/27/mum-died-but-ovo-wont-refund-the-2000-credit-on-her-account\">Continue reading...</a>","category":["Energy bills","Household bills","Money","Consumer affairs","Consumer rights"],"pubDate":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 06:00:22 GMT","guid":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/27/mum-died-but-ovo-wont-refund-the-2000-credit-on-her-account","media:content":[{"media:credit":"Photograph: Paul Melling/Alamy"},{"media:credit":"Photograph: Paul Melling/Alamy"}],"dc:creator":"Anna Tims","dc:date":"2023-04-27T06:00:22Z","keywords":{"refund":1,"credit":4,"account":13,"problem":1,"delaying":4,"probate":4,"causing":4,"great":4,"distress":7,"strong":10,"February":2,"energy":4,"supplier":1,"refusing":1,"return":1,"admitted":1,"errors":1,"which":1,"digit":4,"meter":10,"reading":10,"substituted":1,"actual":1,"basis":1,"subsequent":1,"bills":7,"provided":1,"readings":7,"photographs":1,"agent":1,"assured":1,"would":1,"rectified":1,"never":1,"happened":1,"issue":4,"weeks":1,"resolve":1,"could":1,"funeral":1,"better":1,"London":2,"makes":1,"painful":1,"chase":1,"while":1,"coping":1,"inquest":1,"mother":4,"death":1,"ploughing":1,"through":1,"years":1,"Notes":2,"scribbled":1,"suggest":1,"spent":1,"months":1,"struggling":1,"recalibrated":1,"using":1,"correct":1,"memos":1,"during":1,"repeated":1,"calls":1,"sometimes":1,"passed":1,"fruitlessly":1,"between":1,"departments":1,"point":1,"records":1,"receiving":1,"letter":1,"intimidating":1,"demanding":1,"already":1,"submitted":1,"https":1,"theguardian":1,"money":1,"Continue":2},"summary":"The problem is delaying probate and causing great distressMy mum died in February and her energy supplier Ovo is refusing...","source":"GUARDIAN","feed":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"},{"title":"Etsy sellers offering fake ‘handmade’ products at ripoff prices, says Which?","link":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/27/etsy-sellers-handmade-products-prices-which","description":"<p>Investigation finds rogue sellers charging up to seven times more for products than on other websites </p><p>Etsy bills itself as a marketplace for “unique and creative” goods but scrutiny of its product listings has revealed sellers peddling fake “handmade” products that could be bought for a fraction of the price from big retailers including Amazon, Asda and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/22/bm-boss-simon-arora-to-step-down-from-discount-chain\">discount chain B&amp;M</a>.</p><p>The investigation by the consumer group Which? found rogue sellers charging up to seven times more than on other websites for the items, falsely claiming they were made by hand.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/27/etsy-sellers-handmade-products-prices-which\">Continue reading...</a>","category":["Consumer affairs","E-commerce","Retail industry","Internet","Technology","Money","Business","UK news"],"pubDate":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 05:01:21 GMT","guid":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/apr/27/etsy-sellers-handmade-products-prices-which","media:content":[{"media:credit":"Photograph: Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock"},{"media:credit":"Photograph: Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock"}],"dc:creator":"Zoe Wood","dc:date":"2023-04-27T05:01:21Z","keywords":{"sellers":10,"offering":1,"handmade":4,"products":7,"ripoff":1,"prices":1,"Which":2,"Investigation":2,"finds":1,"rogue":4,"charging":4,"seven":4,"times":4,"other":4,"websites":4,"bills":1,"itself":1,"marketplace":1,"unique":1,"creative":1,"goods":1,"scrutiny":1,"product":1,"listings":1,"revealed":1,"peddling":1,"could":1,"bought":1,"fraction":1,"price":1,"retailers":1,"including":1,"Amazon":2,"https":4,"theguardian":4,"business":1,"simon":1,"arora":1,"discount":4,"chain":4,"investigation":1,"consumer":1,"group":1,"found":1,"items":1,"falsely":1,"claiming":1,"money":1,"which":1,"Continue":2,"reading":1},"summary":"Investigation finds rogue sellers charging up to seven times more for products than on other websites Etsy bills itself as...","source":"GUARDIAN","feed":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/business/rss"},{"title":"I need £2,000 now!

Britain is the <a href=\"https://www.consultancy.uk/news/24145/uk-remains-the-globes-second-largest-consulting-market\" title=\"\">outsourcing capital</a> of Europe.

Mr Cameron correctly argued that the use of consultancies had exploded under New Labour, whose faith in the credo of New Public Management, an agenda that sought to make the public sector function more like a business, produced lucrative opportunities for consultancies. Yet the story was hardly different under the Conservatives. While spending on consultants initially decreased under Mr Cameron’s government, economists Mariana Mazzucato and Rosie Collington note that consultancy firms bid for contracts at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/28/uk-ministers-consultants-whitehall\" title=\"\">cut-price rates</a> in an attempt to gain a foothold in government.

This was the first time Ruthie had seen her mum for three months – not because she didn’t want to go, or through neglect, but because of lockdown. They had done a few Zoom calls, but there was only one iPad to go around the 50 or so residents in the home, it needed to be booked and there had to be a carer free to help, so it only happened every couple of weeks. And anyway, Gloria, who had Alzheimer’s, didn’t get on very well with Zoom. “She thought she was watching us on television,” says Henshall.</p><p>“Visit” is perhaps an exaggeration.
