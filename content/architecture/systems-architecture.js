The virus has spread rapidly around the world, causing significant illness, death, and disruption to economies and societies. The response to the pandemic has highlighted the challenges of managing complex systems, such as the healthcare system, supply chains, and global travel  (Ricoca et al., 2023). COVID-19 has shown us that even seemingly well-established systems can quickly become chaotic and unpredictable when faced with unexpected challenges (Horton, 2020). This has reinforced the importance of systems thinking in understanding and managing complex issues. </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has also demonstrated the critical role of systems architecture in responding to complex and rapidly evolving situations. In the case of COVID-19, systems architecture has been instrumental in enabling the development of effective vaccines, tracking and managing outbreaks, and ensuring that healthcare systems are equipped to handle the influx of patients (Ricoca et al., 2023). The success of these efforts has depended on a clear understanding of the different components of the systems involved, how they interact, and how they can be adapted and optimized in response to changing circumstances. The lessons learned from COVID-19 underscore the importance of systems architecture in providing a roadmap for addressing complex challenges, whether in healthcare, business, technology or other domains.</p><p>In software engineering, systems architecture refers to the process of designing and planning the overall structure of a software system (Al-Saqqa et al. 2020). It involves identifying the different components of a system, defining their relationships and interactions, and establishing the principles and guidelines that govern the system's development and operation. Systems architecture is critical to the success of any software project, as it provides a roadmap for developers, testers, and stakeholders to understand how the system will be built, deployed, and maintained.</p><p>The same principles that apply to systems architecture in the context of disease outbreaks also hold true for software development. Just as complex biological systems require careful planning and coordination to manage, software systems are becoming increasingly complex and difficult to manage without a well-defined architecture. Software development teams must be able to identify the different components of their systems, define their relationships, and establish clear principles and guidelines for their development and operation. This is particularly true in agile software development environments, where speed, flexibility, and collaboration are prioritized. The lessons learned from systems architecture in managing complex biological systems can be applied to software development to ensure that software projects are delivered on time, meet their business and technical requirements, and can be maintained over time. Without a well-defined systems architecture, software projects can become unmanageable and prone to errors, leading to costly delays, project failures, and dissatisfied customers.</p><p>In the context of agile software development, systems architecture takes on even greater significance. Agile methodologies prioritize flexibility, speed, and collaboration, making it critical to have a well-defined architecture that can adapt to changing requirements and evolving technologies. In this article, we will explore the role of systems architecture in agile software delivery and provide insights on how to incorporate it into your agile development processes.</p><h2>Systems Architecture in Agile Software Delivery</h2><p>Agile methodologies emphasize collaboration, iterative development, and continuous delivery, enabling teams to rapidly respond to changing requirements and deliver high-quality software (Muhammad et al., 2014). However, this fast-paced approach can sometimes lead to technical debt, where the development team must continually fix issues that arise due to inadequate system design. This is where systems architecture comes into play.</p><p>Systems architecture in agile software delivery helps ensure that the team builds a flexible and scalable software system that can meet the current and future needs of the business. It establishes the foundation for agile development by providing a clear vision of the system's structure, defining the interfaces between system components, and identifying any potential technical risks early on. By having a well-defined architecture in place, development teams can work more efficiently, avoiding costly rework and delays, and focus on delivering value to the customer.</p><p>In addition, systems architecture in agile development helps ensure that the software is maintainable and extensible over time. As new features and functionality are added to the system, the architecture serves as a guide for how those changes should be implemented. This helps prevent the accumulation of technical debt and ensures that the software remains flexible and scalable.</p><p>Overall, systems architecture plays a critical role in agile software delivery by providing a clear roadmap for development teams to follow, helping them build better software faster, and ensuring that the software remains maintainable and scalable over time.</p><h2>Key Systems Architecture Principles and Practices </h2><p>Incorporating systems architecture into agile software development requires a set of principles and practices that enable teams to build scalable, maintainable, and extensible systems. Here are some key principles and practices to consider:</p><ul><li>Start with a clear vision: Before developing the architecture, it is essential to define the purpose, scope, and goals of the system. This will guide the development of the architecture and ensure that it aligns with the overall objectives.</li><li>Prioritize flexibility and scalability: The architecture should be designed with flexibility and scalability in mind, so the system can adapt to changing requirements and technology. A good example of this is serverless function architecture, which allows individual components of the system to be developed, tested, and deployed independently.</li><li>Follow a modular design approach: A modular design approach involves dividing the system into smaller, independently testable components that can be developed, tested, and deployed quickly. This approach allows for faster development, testing, and deployment cycles, reducing the overall time-to-market.</li><li>Use patterns and standards: Established design patterns and industry standards should be leveraged to ensure consistency and interoperability across system components. For instance, deciding on a front-end framework that can be used across a program of work.</li><li>Focus on user needs: The architecture should be designed with the user's needs in mind, ensuring that the system is user-friendly and meets the business and technical requirements. An example of this is the User-Centered Design (UCD) approach, which involves designing software based on user feedback and testing.</li><li>Test the architecture: The architecture should be tested through prototypes and simulations to identify any technical risks and refine the design. This testing should be done early in the development cycle to reduce the risk of costly errors later on.</li><li>Collaborate and iterate: All stakeholders should be involved in the development process, and the architecture should be continuously iterated based on feedback. This approach ensures that the system meets the needs of all stakeholders and reduces the risk of misunderstandings.</li><li>Maintain and evolve the architecture: The architecture should be regularly updated as the system evolves, documenting any changes and communicating them to all stakeholders. This ensures that the system remains up-to-date and aligns with the overall goals of the project.</li></ul><p>By following these principles and practices, development teams can build a robust architecture that enables agile software delivery, ensuring that the system is scalable, maintainable, and extensible over time.</p><h2>Benefits of Incorporating Systems Architecture Thinking</h2><p>Incorporating systems architecture in agile software development can yield numerous benefits, including:</p><ul><li>Better collaboration: Systems architecture provides a shared understanding of the system's design and components, enabling teams to collaborate more effectively and make better decisions.</li><li>Improved scalability: A well-designed architecture ensures that the system can scale to handle increasing user demands and changing requirements.</li><li>Faster delivery: By establishing a clear roadmap for development, systems architecture can help teams deliver software faster, with fewer errors and delays.</li><li>Reduced technical debt: A well-defined architecture can help prevent technical debt from accumulating, reducing the need for costly rework and maintenance.</li><li>Improved maintainability: By designing the system with maintainability in mind, systems architecture can reduce the cost and effort required to maintain the software over time.</li><li>Better alignment with business goals: Systems architecture helps ensure that the system is aligned with the business goals and objectives, enabling teams to deliver software that meets the needs of the business.</li><li>Increased stakeholder satisfaction: By delivering high-quality software that meets the needs of all stakeholders, systems architecture can increase stakeholder satisfaction and drive business value.</li></ul><h2>Potential Challenges and How to Address Them</h2><p>Incorporating systems architecture in agile software development can present some challenges, such as:</p><ul><li>Balancing agility and documentation: Agile development emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation, making it challenging to document the architecture adequately.</li><li>Changing requirements: Agile development requires the system to adapt to changing requirements, which can affect the architecture and design.</li><li>Technical debt: Even with a well-designed architecture, agile development can result in technical debt, requiring additional time and effort to maintain the software.</li></ul><p>To address these challenges, consider the following:</p><ul><li>Balance documentation and agility: While agile development prioritizes working software, it's essential to document the architecture to ensure that the system remains maintainable and extensible over time. Consider using lightweight documentation techniques, such as diagrams or user stories, to document the architecture.</li><li>Embrace change: Agile development requires the system to adapt to changing requirements, and the architecture should be flexible enough to accommodate those changes. Continuously iterate on the architecture based on feedback, and embrace change as a natural part of the development process.</li><li>Address technical debt: While a well-designed architecture can help prevent technical debt, it's still possible to accumulate it in agile development. Address technical debt through regular refactoring, code reviews, and testing to ensure that the software remains maintainable and scalable.</li></ul><h2>Best Practices for Incorporating Systems Architecture</h2><p>To effectively incorporate systems architecture in agile software development, consider the following best practices:</p><ul><li>Involve all stakeholders: Ensure that all stakeholders, including developers, architects, business analysts, and end-users, are involved in the architecture and design process to ensure that the system meets everyone's needs.</li><li>Use lightweight documentation: Use lightweight documentation techniques, such as diagrams, user stories, and prototypes, to document the architecture and design, ensuring that it's easy to understand and maintain.</li><li>Foster a collaborative culture: Foster a culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing among team members, ensuring that everyone understands the system's architecture and design.</li><li>Focus on quality: Prioritize software quality throughout the development process, ensuring that the system is reliable, maintainable, and scalable.</li><li>Continuously iterate on the architecture: Continuously iterate on the architecture based on feedback from stakeholders and changing requirements, ensuring that the system remains flexible and adaptable.</li><li>Embrace change: Embrace change as a natural part of the development process, ensuring that the architecture is designed to accommodate changing requirements and technologies.</li><li>Leverage automation: Leverage automation to streamline the development process, reducing errors, and speeding up delivery.</li></ul><h2>Case Study: Building an API Service within a Digital Bank Context</h2><p>In this section, we'll explore a case study of a software development team that was tasked with building an API service within a digital bank context. This will hopefully give a more ‘real life’ example on how to leverage systems architecture best practice.</p><p>“As a software developer on the team tasked with building an API service within a digital bank context, we faced the challenge of creating a scalable, maintainable, and extensible system. Here's how we tackled this challenge:</p><p>Situation: The digital bank wanted to create an API service that would allow third-party developers to access its banking services, such as account balances, transaction history, and payments.</p><p>Task: Our team was responsible for designing and implementing the architecture for the API service, while working in an agile development environment.</p><p>Action: To create the architecture for the API service, we followed these steps:</p><ul><li>We began by identifying the key features and functionalities that the API service needed to support, based on the requirements provided by the digital bank.</li><li>Next, we created a high-level architecture diagram that outlined the major components of the system, such as the API gateway, services, and data stores. We used this diagram as a basis for discussion with our team members and stakeholders to ensure that we all agreed on the architecture's approach.</li><li>We then went into more detail and created detailed architecture diagrams for each component, using modeling tools to ensure that we had a clear understanding of how each part of the system would work.</li><li>We chose to use Docker and Kubernetes to containerize the services, as we knew this would give us scalability and flexibility to handle future demands.</li><li>We continuously iterated on the architecture, taking feedback from stakeholders and team members, and updating our designs as necessary.</li></ul><p>Results: Our implementation of the API service architecture in the agile development environment was successful. We saw several benefits from this approach, such as:</p><ul><li>We could scale the system easily, thanks to the containerization approach.</li><li>The architecture made it easy to manage the system and troubleshoot issues, as we could easily identify the root cause of any problems.</li><li>We could implement changes and updates quickly and easily, thanks to the modular approach we took.</li><li>The overall quality of the system improved, as we could test each component independently, ensuring that they worked as intended before we integrated them.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, our team's successful implementation of systems architecture in agile software development for the digital bank's API service showed us the value of taking an iterative and collaborative approach. By creating a flexible and scalable architecture that prioritized maintainability, we could deliver a high-quality product that met the needs of stakeholders and end-users alike.”</p><h2>10 ‘Top Tips’</h2><p>Here are ten practical tips for successful implementation of systems architecture in agile software development, along with a specific example for each:</p><ol><li>Define the scope of the system clearly: Clearly define the boundaries and interfaces of the system to ensure that everyone involved understands what the system will do and what it won't.
